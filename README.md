ScholarScribe helps researchers who are writing their own manuscripts to:

- **Run open LLMs fully offline** — Gemma 3, Qwen 3, Phi-4, DeepSeek R1, Llama 3.3, and more. No paid APIs, no OpenAI/Anthropic/Google calls.
- **Import local `.gguf` files** — pick a model file you already downloaded (e.g. from HuggingFace); ScholarScribe checks whether your device has enough RAM, then registers it with Ollama.
- **Clean messy text** with the AI Text Cleaner — 24 rule-based transformations (12 default + 11 strict) for PDF/web/OCR artifacts: broken hyphens, ligatures, mojibake, page numbers, broken citations, hidden chars, asterisks, markdown headings, ellipsis, bullets, BOM, non-breaking spaces, Unicode whitespace, and more. One-click "⚡ Strict clean" applies all 24.
- **Two `.docx` modes**: extract text only (loses formatting, runs all cleaners), or clean in place (preserves all tables, images, hyperlinks, headers/footers, styles, track changes).
- **Validate citations** against your `.bib` file — lists undefined citations, unused references, and broken in-text citations. Reduces the risk of fabricated references.
- **See document statistics** — word count, section count, citation count, reading time, and comparison with common journal targets.
- **Analyze document structure** — extract heading tree, get suggestions for missing sections (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusion, etc.), spot short sections.
- **Generate a structured abstract** — local LLM produces a Background/Methods/Results/Conclusions abstract from your draft. Runs entirely on your device.
- **Analyze whether a draft sounds like *your own* prior writing** — descriptive statistics including sentence length, hedging, passive voice, plus readability metrics (Flesch, Flesch-Kincaid, Gunning Fog).
- **Generate venue-compliant AI-use disclosure statements** for ICMJE, Nature, IEEE, Elsevier, ACL, and more.
- **Understand how AI detectors actually work** — and where they fail. Educational content with peer-reviewed citations.
- **Verify the app's own privacy claims** via an in-app Privacy Audit log of every file read and outbound HTTP call.
- **Save drafts locally** — opt-in persistence stores your work as plain JSON files on your device. Never synced to the cloud.
- **Light, dark, and auto themes** — click the icon in the sidebar to cycle.

## Ethical Use — please read

ScholarScribe is designed for researchers who have genuinely written or substantially contributed to a manuscript and wish to work with AI assistance transparently and on their own device.

### What ScholarScribe does

- Helps you draft, paraphrase, and refine **your own** writing with a local LLM.
- Compares a draft's stylistic profile to a sample of **your own prior writing** so you can decide whether the draft still sounds like you.
- Generates **disclosure statements** so you can comply with journal and conference AI-use policies.
- Educates you about how AI-detection tools work and what their known limitations are.
- Validates your citations against your `.bib` file — reducing the risk of fabricated references in your manuscript.
- Cleans text artifacts from copy-pasted content without rewriting it.

### What ScholarScribe explicitly does NOT do

- **Does not target or attempt to lower AI-detection scores.** No "marker-targeting" engine. No Turnitin/GPTZero/Originality score-reduction pipeline. No stealth modes.
- **Does not help misrepresent AI-generated text as original human work.** The chat module's system prompt explicitly refuses requests to evade detectors or submit AI output as one's own.
- **Does not contact any third-party API.** The only network call is to `registry.ollama.ai` when you choose to download a model — and that call carries no text, no prompts, no usage data.
- **Does not collect telemetry, analytics, or crash reports.**
- **Does not read any file you didn't explicitly pick in a file dialog.**
- **Does not fabricate citations.** The Chat tab's system prompt forbids this. The new Citation Manager feature exists precisely to catch accidental fabrication by listing every in-text citation that doesn't match a real `.bib` entry.

If you are looking for a tool to "humanize" AI text to bypass Turnitin, this is not that tool. The author of this project believes detection-evasion tools cause net harm to research integrity — and disproportionately harm honest researchers, especially non-native English writers, who are most likely to be falsely accused of AI use and would be most harmed by an arms race between evaders and detectors.

### Your responsibility

Users are responsible for compliance with their institution's AI-use policies and the policies of any venue to which they submit. When in doubt, disclose AI assistance. When still in doubt, ask your editor.

See [`docs/ETHICS.md`](docs/ETHICS.md) for the full ethical-use policy.

## Installation

### 1. Install Ollama (the local LLM runtime)

ScholarScribe uses [Ollama](https://ollama.com) as its backend — a free, open-source local LLM runner.

1. Download Ollama from <https://ollama.com/download> (Windows installer, ~150 MB).
2. Run the installer. Ollama starts automatically as a background service.
3. Look for the Ollama icon (a llama) in your system tray.

That's it — you don't need to use Ollama directly. ScholarScribe talks to it on `http://127.0.0.1:11434`.

### 2. Install ScholarScribe

**Option A — download the pre-built installer (recommended for most users)**

Grab the latest `.msi` or `.exe` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/waleedmandour/scholarscribe/releases). Double-click to install. ScholarScribe will appear in your Start menu.

**Option B — build from source**

Requires Rust 1.77+, Node.js 18+, and the Tauri prerequisites (Microsoft Visual Studio C++ Build Tools, WebView2 — see the [Tauri prerequisites guide](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/)).

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/waleedmandour/scholarscribe.git
cd scholarscribe
npm install
npm run tauri build
```

The installer appears in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`.

**Option C — let a bootstrap script do it**

If you're on a fresh Windows machine, `scripts/build-windows.ps1` will check for / install all prerequisites (Rust, Node, MSVC, WebView2, Ollama), run `npm install` and `cargo check`, then build the .msi. Run it from PowerShell:

```powershell
.\scripts\build-windows.ps1
```

### Quick start (5 minutes)

See **[`USER_GUIDE.md`](USER_GUIDE.md)** for a focused 5-minute walkthrough. The longer reference manual is in **[`USER_MANUAL.md`](USER_MANUAL.md)**.

## Feature overview

### Models tab

Install and manage open LLMs. The catalog includes 14 models spanning 4 GB to 64 GB RAM:

- **Gemma 3 family** (Google 2025): 1B / 4B / 12B / 27B — multimodal, strong on academic text
- **Qwen 3 family** (Alibaba 2025): 4B / 8B / 14B / 32B — multilingual (30+ languages), hybrid thinking-mode
- **Phi-4** (Microsoft 2024): 14B + Mini 3.8B — STEM-specialized, trained on synthetic academic data
- **DeepSeek R1** (2025): 14B / 32B — open reasoning model with explicit chain-of-thought
- **Llama 3.3 70B** (Meta 2024) — flagship, requires 64 GB+ RAM
- **SciGLM 6B** (Tsinghua) — academic-tuned, trained on scientific papers

You can also:
- **Install by name** — any Ollama-supported model (e.g. `mistral:7b`, `command-r`)
- **Import a local `.gguf` file** — pick a model file you downloaded directly from HuggingFace. ScholarScribe checks your device's RAM against the model's needs (file size × 1.5) and shows a verdict: `ok`, `tight` (close other apps), or `insufficient` (model too large for your RAM). Import calls Ollama's `/api/create` — zero outbound network.

### Text Cleaner tab

**24 rule-based text transformations** that fix common artifacts from copy-pasted text — especially from PDFs, web pages, OCR, and word processors. Two presets:

- **Default** (12 ops): fix mojibake, expand ligatures, normalize quotes/dashes, strip zero-width/control chars, join hyphenated line breaks, join broken sentences, join broken URLs, fix broken citations, remove page numbers, collapse whitespace.
- **Strict** (24 ops, ⚡ button): all of the above PLUS strip BOM, normalize line endings (CRLF→LF), convert non-breaking spaces, normalize Unicode whitespace, strip soft hyphens, strip variation selectors, convert ellipsis (…→...), remove asterisks (*), remove markdown headings (#), normalize bullets (•→-), collapse repeated punctuation (!!!→!).

| Default operation | What it fixes |
|---|---|
| Fix mojibake | `â€™` → `'`, `â€"` → `—`, `Ã©` → `é` (UTF-8 decoded as Latin-1) |
| Expand ligatures | `ﬁ` → `fi`, `ﬂ` → `fl`, `ﬀ` → `ff`, `ﬃ` → `ffi` |
| Normalize quotes | Curly → straight (off by default; preserves academic style) |
| Normalize dashes | `--` → `—`, en-dash → hyphen |
| Strip zero-width chars | U+200B/200C/200D/FEFF/2060 (invisible but cause issues) |
| Strip control chars | Non-printable C0/C1 chars except tab/newline |
| Join hyphenated line breaks | `exam-\nple` → `example` (classic PDF artifact) |
| Join broken sentences | Lines ending mid-sentence joined (preserves paragraph breaks) |
| Join broken URLs | `https://example.\ncom` → `https://example.com` |
| Fix broken citations | `(Smith,\n2020)` → `(Smith, 2020)` |
| Remove page numbers | Standalone number lines from PDF extraction |
| Collapse whitespace | Multiple spaces → one, trim trailing, 3+ newlines → 2 |

| Strict-only operation | What it fixes |
|---|---|
| Strip BOM | U+FEFF at start of file |
| Normalize line endings | CRLF → LF, lone CR → LF |
| Convert non-breaking spaces | U+00A0, U+2007, U+202F → ASCII space |
| Normalize Unicode whitespace | en/em/thin/hair/figure/ideographic spaces → ASCII space |
| Strip soft hyphens | U+00AD (invisible chars that cause search misses) |
| Strip variation selectors | U+FE00–FE0F, U+E0100–E01EF (emoji/symbol modifiers) |
| Convert ellipsis | Unicode `…` → three ASCII dots `...` |
| Remove asterisks | All `*` characters (markdown bold/italic markers, footnote refs) |
| Remove markdown headings | Leading `#`, `##`, `###` from lines (preserves heading text) |
| Normalize bullets | `• ◦ ▪ ‣ ⁃` → ASCII hyphen `-` |
| Collapse repeated punctuation | `!!!` → `!`, `???` → `?`, `;;` → `;` |

**Two `.docx` modes** when a Word document is loaded:

1. **Extract & clean text** — extracts text and runs all enabled transformations. Loses formatting but applies every cleaner including cross-paragraph ones.
2. **Clean & save as .docx (preserves format)** — modifies each `<w:t>` text run in place. Preserves all tables, images, hyperlinks, headers/footers, footnotes/endnotes, styles, theme, and track changes. Saves to a new `.docx` (default name `<original>-cleaned.docx`). Cross-paragraph operations (join broken lines, fix broken citations, remove page numbers) are skipped because they'd require restructuring the document.

### Citation Manager tab *(new in v0.1.6)*

Validates your draft's in-text citations against your `.bib` (BibTeX) file. Three checks:

1. **Undefined citations** — every `(Author, Year)` or `(Author et al., Year)` in your draft that doesn't match an entry in your `.bib` file. These are the citations most likely to be fabricated or wrong.
2. **Unused references** — every `.bib` entry that's never cited in your draft. Helps you trim your reference list before submission.
3. **Citation count per reference** — how many times each `.bib` entry is cited, so you can spot references that are cited only once (often a sign of a token citation).

All parsing is local. No `.bib` content leaves your device. The BibTeX parser is hand-written (no third-party BibTeX dependency).

### Document Statistics tab *(new in v0.1.6)*

A quick health-check panel for your draft:

- Word count, sentence count, paragraph count, section count (extracted from headings)
- Citation count (any `(Author, Year)` or `[N]` pattern)
- Average sentence length, type-token ratio, complex-word ratio
- Estimated reading time (at 200 wpm)
- Flesch Reading Ease, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, Gunning Fog Index
- Comparison panel: how your draft compares to common journal targets (e.g. Nature articles average ~5,000 words; ICMJE medical articles ~3,500 words; IEEE conference papers ~6,000 words)

### Style Analysis tab

Compare a draft's stylistic profile to a sample of **your own** prior writing. Reports 12 metrics:

- Sentence length (mean + standard deviation)
- Vocabulary diversity (type-token ratio)
- Passive-voice density
- Hedging density (perhaps, possibly, may, etc.)
- Connector density (however, moreover, therefore, etc.)
- First-person singular/plural ratio
- Citation density
- Reading-level metrics (Flesch, Flesch-Kincaid, Gunning Fog)
- Complex-word ratio

Output: overall distance score + feature-by-feature comparison with interpretations ("very close", "minor difference", "notable difference", "substantial difference"). Use this to spot drafts that drift away from your usual register.

**What this is — and isn't.** Style Analysis tells *you* how your draft compares to *your own* writing. It does not predict or attempt to lower AI-detector scores.

### Chat tab

Local-only chat with any installed model. The system prompt includes a guardrail that refuses requests to evade AI detectors or fabricate citations. Use it for:

- Brainstorming phrasing
- Asking for critique of a paragraph
- Generating outlines
- Sanity-checking an argument

### Disclosure Assistant tab

Generate venue-compliant AI-use disclosure statements for:

- **ICMJE** (medical journals: JAMA, NEJM, Lancet, BMJ, etc.)
- **Nature Portfolio** journals
- **IEEE** (all societies)
- **Elsevier** (2,500+ journals)
- **ACL / EMNLP / NAACL** (NLP conferences)
- **Generic / custom venue**

Fill in the tool used, the task, the model (optional), and your name (optional). One click generates a properly-formatted statement ready to paste into your manuscript or cover letter. Each template includes a link to the venue's official AI-use policy.

### Detector Literacy tab

Plain-English explainer of how AI-detection tools (Turnitin AI, GPTZero, Originality.ai) work and where they fail:

- **Perplexity and burstiness** — the two main signals most detectors use
- **Where detectors fail** — false-positive bias against non-native English writers, unreliability on short passages, sensitivity to editing, adversarial fragility
- **What this means for you** — practical guidance depending on whether you wrote the draft yourself, used AI assistance, or are an instructor/reviewer
- **Further reading** — Liang et al. (2023), Weber-Wulff et al. (2023), Laban et al. (2024)

Educational only — does not help you evade detection.

### Privacy Audit tab

In-session log of every file read + outbound HTTP call. The summary card shows:

- Total events, file reads, HTTP calls, Ollama commands
- Bytes in / out
- **Unique outbound hosts contacted** — should only ever show `registry.ollama.ai` (model downloads). Any other host is a red flag.

Filterable event table with timestamps. The audit log is **in-memory only** — cleared on app close. This is intentional: persisting it would create a record of every file you read, which is the opposite of privacy.

### Saved Work tab

Opt-in local persistence. Disabled by default. When enabled:

- Drafts, chat transcripts, disclosure statements save as plain JSON files in `%APPDATA%\com.scholarscribe.app\data\`
- Plain JSON — inspectable in any text editor
- Never synced to cloud (no OneDrive/Dropbox integration by ScholarScribe)
- Per-draft delete + "Delete all"
- "Open folder in Explorer" button to see exactly what's stored
- Full privacy disclosure dialog before enabling — explains what gets saved, where, encryption status, deletion behavior

The Privacy Audit log is **never** persisted — it stays in-memory only.

### About tab

Version, environment (CPU, RAM, OS), credits, acknowledgments.

## Privacy

| Property | Status |
|---|---|
| Telemetry | **None.** No analytics, no crash reporting, no usage tracking. |
| Network calls | One outbound call, to `registry.ollama.ai`, only when you click "Download" on a model. Carries no text or usage data. GGUF imports make zero outbound calls. |
| User text | **Never leaves your device.** Drafts, reference samples, chat messages, .bib files — all stay in memory or local files. |
| Third-party APIs | **None.** No OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI, or any other cloud LLM API. |
| Crash reports | None collected. Errors are written to a local log file only. |
| Saved drafts | Opt-in only. Plain JSON in `%APPDATA%\com.scholarscribe.app\data\`. Never synced. |
| Audit log | In-memory only. Cleared on app close. Never persisted. |

The CSP in `tauri.conf.json` explicitly restricts outbound connections from the UI to `127.0.0.1:11434` (your local Ollama). The Rust backend only contacts `ollama.com` for model downloads and nothing else.

If you want to verify this yourself:
1. Audit `src-tauri/src/ollama.rs` — every outbound HTTP call is in that file.
2. Watch the Privacy Audit tab while interacting with the app.
3. Run ScholarScribe behind a network monitor (GlassWire, Wireshark) and cross-reference outbound hosts.

See [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) for the full security policy.

- **v0.1.6** — **Citation Manager** (BibTeX validation against draft) + **Document Statistics** panel + comprehensive README + user guide
- **v0.1.7** — Strict cleaning mode: 11 new operations (strip BOM, normalize line endings, convert non-breaking spaces, normalize Unicode whitespace, strip soft hyphens, strip variation selectors, convert ellipsis, remove asterisks, remove markdown headings, normalize bullets, collapse repeated punctuation). One-click "⚡ Strict clean" button applies all 24 operations.
- **v0.1.8** (this release) — **Structure Analyzer** (extract heading tree, suggest missing sections) + **Abstract Generator** (LLM-generated structured abstract) + "⚡ Strict clean & save as .docx" button (combines strict cleaning with format preservation).
- **v0.2** (planned) — Multi-reference style profile (analyze against a folder of your papers rather than one)
- **v0.3** (planned) — Bundled llama.cpp option, so users who can't install Ollama separately still get a working app
- **v0.4** (planned) — Citation-aware chat (LLM sees your `.bib` file and avoids fabricating references in chat responses)
